I was already late. It was almost 6:58. The first period starts at 6:50. But yesterday, despite my lateness, I had made it; I had sneaked into my classroom stealthy like a ninja. But today, I was both praying and trying select a genuine excuse from my list of excuses in a constant fear that if ever Discpline Incharge (DI) spots me. I was trying to pace my steps as fast as I can with my forever-cold-hands inside my pant pockets. Within a few minutes, I hit the highway, with a new hope that I could also make it today while walking along the foggy road. Seeing two dim headlights approaching towards me, I gave a thumb lift in the air, thinking it as a bus, but it was a truck. I sustained my steps again with the disappointment in my face, thinking about how late I’m going to be. Few minutes later, another one came by but thankfully it happened to be the bus.</p><p> I got on the bus. The bus wasn’t packed like always, people were not hanging in those bars across the alleys and through the doors. I looked for seats and there was one seat left unattended in alley side, with a college girl, in the window seat. I didn’t wholly pay attention to her face but chose to sit next to her, knowing already that I act weirdly with girls. As the bus was speeding, it was getting colder, but we weren't touching each other, the cold air was hitting my left thigh because of the gap between us and I don't know if she felt the same. She was having a snack (popular local Dalmoth) while scrolling through her phone. That Dalmoth is spicy. I pondered "why would you in this early morning?". The same Dalmoth was inside my bag. As I told, it was a common snack. For a while, I thought to open my bag and start chewing along with her, and then I wondered do I look like that kind of person? There were other college girls behind our seats, probably the same college, as long as I remember they were too wearing some college sweaters. And because of that, I got nervous, my neck got stiff, I swear I couldn’t even dare to look towards her window whenever the bus stopped for passengers. I thought I will let my fate play the role &amp; I’ll sit there gazing at those dangling grab handles, in that way I thought it would be cool that I wasn’t thinking about looking at her face and till that time, she didn’t bother to look at mine.</p><p>She might have picked up 3 calls back-to-back each of ten seconds to be precise, I didn’t hear her exact words as buses have the tradition to play music at the fullest volume possible. Meanwhile, I was just slightly headbanging and finger-drumming over the bag in my lap. The conductor came to collect our fares, I handed him 10 rupees note from my bag pocket. After some distraction made from her, I thought to show the phone that I had bought a month ago. I fingerprint unlocked from my lock screen and gawked at my home screen for so long that I don’t recall till when and sometimes later I got brought into reality when one passenger from back seat stop came.</p><p>There came a feeling, a nerve that I should really do something. If there was any girl from my college, I have had already asked for her snack, asked her to share her muffler, ask her to come closer, etc., etc. As I said, I’m weird with girls. I didn’t even have a sign of single courage to look her how pretty she was. The sad part isn’t that I didn’t talk to her but the sad part is I got paralyzed. My face, my neck got stiff. I felt black everywhere like I’m visually impaired when I finally thought to turn my head once towards this girl since my stop was coming. The conductor shouted my college name to remind me my stop was approaching the next and my heartbeats were never the same.</p><p>I grabbed my bag with one hand &amp; I knew I have to act cool and I tried walking towards the exit door, I thought to look this window girl’s face when I get out of the bus; once I get far from her electromagnetic forces, where she would have no control over me. As I got down from the bus, I stood there to get a glimpse of her face through the windows and to my dismay, it was frosty. Everything was blur. How could I have forgotten about that? With that discontentment, I looked over my watch, it was already 7:20 &amp; I was walking discerning about her, unaware about the excuses I have to come up with, lectures I have to listen from DI…</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
